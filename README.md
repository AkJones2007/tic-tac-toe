# tic-tac-toe v1.0
A simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe created for my Unit 1 project for General Assembly.

##Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- AJAX

### Version 1.0
Version 1.0 of Tic-Tac-Toe is a front-end web application produced using JavaScript for functionality, 
utilizing JQuery to communicate with HTML and the DOM, and AJAX to interface with a back-end API. 
This project was a great first stride into the world of web development as I learned how to use 
these technologies together to create a dynamic, interactive application for use on the web.

My main struggle with this project was figuring out how to incorporate my JavaScript code with AJAX to produce
additional functionality, allowing users to sign in, save the game state and even play the game with friends
over the internet. I was unable to complete anything beyond the login and registration.

In the next version, I plan to add this functionality, along with a feature that allows the game to be
customized by specifying a board size, and choosing the number of rounds to play.
